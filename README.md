Posters put up for fun in the NYU MIAP Digital Forensics Lab (aka the Old Media Lab, aka the Dead Media Lab, aka the Mona Jimenez Complex Media Lab, aka The Room with the Old Computers)

"ROOT" explains the contents/purpose of directories at the root level of Unix (Mac/Linux) systems, including handy notes about where common DigiPres-related files (like Homebrew installations) live.

The "OS and Kernel Family Tree" graphs out relationships/development of some of history's biggest/most important operating systems. Underlying kernels are in circles and color-coded by approximate "generation".
